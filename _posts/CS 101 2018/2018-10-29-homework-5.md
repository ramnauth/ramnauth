# Posts need to have the `post` layout
layout: post

# The title of your post
title: Assignment 5 due Sun, Nov. 11

# (Optional) Write a short (~150 characters) description of each blog post.
# This description is used to preview the page on search engines, social media, etc.
description: >
   **Assigned** Monday, Oct. 29; **Due** Sun, Nov. 11 at 11:59 PM;

# (Optional) Link to an image that represents your blog post.
# The aspect ratio should be ~16:9.

# You can hide the description and/or image from the output
# (only visible to search engines) by setting:
# hide_description: true
# hide_image: true

# (Optional) Each post can have zero or more categories, and zero or more tags.
# The difference is that categories will be part of the URL, while tags will not.
# E.g. the URL of this post is <site.baseurl>/hydejack/2017/11/23/example-content/

tags: [Assignments]
# If you want a category or tag to have its own page,
# check out `_featured_categories` and `_featured_tags` respectively.

Before starting this assignment, you should review the Python lecture, including the exercises at the bottom of the notes.

In this assignment, you will write and test a short numeric guessing game in Python. Complete this assignment in our online classroom 
([repl.it/classroom/](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/10YUXv2)) and press 'submit' when you're finished.

## Requirements
Here are the game requirements:
- Your program MUST have a comment at the top containing your name, the date, and a description of the game.
- The game must start by asking for the player’s name. It can then use that name throughout in creative ways, such as “Lucky guess, Ralph!” or “Thanks for playing, Samantha!”
- Next, the program chooses a random number between 1 and 100. To do this in Python, you need these lines:
```py
import random
secretNumber = random.randrange(1,101)
```
and then the variable `secretNumber` will contain the random number.
- The player repeatedly guesses the number, and the program provides feedback such as “too high” or “too low.”
- The program should count how many guesses the player makes, and report that at the end.
- Once the player guesses the correct number, the program should announce that the game is over, and it should end.
- Complete one or more of the following extras

## Extras
- Give the player a limited number of guesses, such as 6 or 7. If he or she doesn’t get the correct number in that many guesses, the game is lost.
- Give the player a difficulty option. The easy game is a number between 1 and 100, but the difficult game goes 1 to 1,000. (If you are also doing the limited number of guesses, then the larger range can allow up to 9 guesses.)
- Find a way to respond politely if the user enters an invalid response. For example, if the user enters “ugh” then the program will probably crash with an error. Instead, make it say “Sorry, want to try that guess again?”

## Transcripts of sample games
Here are some transcripts of sample games that I played with my solution. The user’s input is indicated by «angle quotes».
### Game 1
Alice paid attention in algorithms class and is using a binary search to play the game.
```
Welcome to the guessing game.
What is your name? «Alice»
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Your guess? «50»
Too high!
Your guess? «25»
Too low!
Your guess? «38»
Too high!
Your guess? «31»
Too low!
Your guess? «34»
Too high!
Your guess? «33»
Yes, my secret number was 33
Congratulations, Alice you got it in 6 guesses
```
### Game 2
Bob doesn’t know about binary search, so it takes him much longer.
```
Welcome to the guessing game.
What is your name? «Bob»
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Your guess? «10»
Too low!
Your guess? «20»
Too low!
Your guess? «30»
Too low!
Your guess? «40»
Too low!
Your guess? «50»
Too low!
Your guess? «60»
Too low!
Your guess? «70»
Too high!
Your guess? «65»
Too low!
Your guess? «66»
Too low!
Your guess? «67»
Too low!
Your guess? «68»
Too low!
Your guess? «69»
Yes, my secret number was 69
Congratulations, Bob you got it in 12 guesses
```
### Game 3
Carla is a little haphazard with the binary search, but still does pretty well.
```
Welcome to the guessing game.
What is your name? «Carla»
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Your guess? «50»
Too low!
Your guess? «75»
Too low!
Your guess? «90»
Too high!
Your guess? «82»
Too high!
Your guess? «78»
Too low!

Your guess? «79»
Yes, my secret number was 79
Congratulations, Carla you got it in 7 guesses
