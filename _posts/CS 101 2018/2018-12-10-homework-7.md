Complete the worksheets given in class/attached below:

## Monoalphabetic cipher 

**(1)**[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HIOk1tDG_lRAkGGiO5CQo3gz3g2fN0Yv/view?usp=sharing). You are provided a piece of text encoded using a single-substitution (monoalphabetic) cipher. Your task is to **crack the code** and discover the secret poem. You should start by doing a **frequency analysis** of the letters in your text.

## Vigenère cipher
**(2)** Using the polyalphabetic substitution table ([PDF](https://liucs.net/cs101f18/vigenere.pdf)), encrypt the following messages:
- message: `ATTACKATDAWN`, key: `LEMON`
- message: `WEHAVEWON`, key: `HELLO`
- message: `HOWAREYOUTODAY`, key: `FINE`

**(3)** A secret message is encoded with the keyword `BLIMP`. Work backwards to decrypt `HLUQDWPZ`. The result should be two actual English words.
