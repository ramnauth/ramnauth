# (Optional) Each post can have zero or more categories, and zero or more tags.
# The difference is that categories will be part of the URL, while tags will not.

Retaking an exam is not a right, it's an *opportunity* that you must earn. Students who don't do any of their work or don't put any effort to their retake attempt do not deserve a chance to waste the teacher's time. 

Therefore, in my class, 
- Students **must have all work submitted** that relates to the test **before** their retake is considered.
- Retaking an exam means completing the Retake Form [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-uCrYTsO01ZRerhbd_DWSE4hetm-iwUH/view?usp=sharing)
- Submitting original and retake exam on the specified due date.
