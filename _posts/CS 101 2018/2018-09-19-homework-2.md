**Read the lecture notes** on [Text Encoding & Compression](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20101/2018/09/19/text-encoding/).

Then, using the given [Huffman Tree](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20101/2018/09/19/text-encoding/#huffman-coding), **encode the following words**.

1. King
2. Queen
3. Bishop
4. Knight
5. Rook
6. Pawn

Finally, **encode the letters of your last name**. For example, my last name (`RAMNAUTH`) encoded using the Huffman algorithm would be:
- `R` = `0000`
- `A` = `1100`
- `M` = `111101`
- `N` = `0101`
- `A` = `1100`
- `U` = `111111`
- `T` = `1110`
- `H` = `0001`

Therefore, `RAMNAUTH` can be represented as `0000 1100 111101 0101 1100 111111 1110 0001`. 

**Reminder**: Notebooks are collected and graded on Mondays.
