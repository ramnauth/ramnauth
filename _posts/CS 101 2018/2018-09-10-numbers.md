## Positional Numbering & Bases

The **positional** numeral system is a system of **numbers** by an ordered set of numeral symbols (aka *digits*) for which the value of a numeral symbol depends on its **position**. In other words, the value of the digits is known by their place. 

For example, the number system that we know and use is **base 10** (decimal notation). Base 10 uses 10 numeral symbols: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, and `9`. So, to read a number in base 10, we rely on each digit's **place value**. 
To illustrate: `639` can be read as `six hundred thirty nine` and written as `6 x 100 + 3 x 10 + 9 x 1`.

![Base 10 Notation](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=1wQJF5uCpg93kjkDVH51IpT2DhfFEuK0l)

Base 10 is not the only base there is. In fact, we can use any number we can think of as a base in the positional numbering system. For instance, let's try out [base three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_numeral_system). 
In base 3, the numeral symbols we can work with are `0`, `1`, and `2`. This is like in base 10, where the symbols we use are `0` to `9`. <br>

The number above, `201` in base 3, is equal to `19` in base 10. Why? Because `201` (in base 3) is `2 x 9 + 0 x 3 + 1 x 1` which equals `19` (base 10).

Now, what do we do when we want to convert *from base 10* to a foreign base?

One method (perhaps the quickest) is to create a bunch of slots and label them according to the base we want to convert to. In the problem above, we want to convert `65` to base 3. 
I stopped created slots when I reached the `eighty ones` position because I realized that `81` is too large for any integer to multiply by it and "fit" into `65`. So, we'll put a `0` in the `eighty ones` position and move to the next slot: the `twenty sevens` position.
Here, `2 x 27` ( = `54`) is the largest multiple of `27` that can fit into `65`. Let's put a `2` in that slot. Our remainder (what we have left of `65` to work with) is `65 - 54` = `11`.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hl1RKm1gNt3SI5FcJQM-SJEhEcA-DiMN/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

Next is the `nines` position. How many `nines` can fit into our remainder, `11`? `9 x 2`? No, that's too big. `9 x 1`? Yes! Let's put a `1` in the `nines` position and calculate our remainder (`11 - 9` = `2`). <br>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pT7C5UUiEU5tWDPS2Zerx7AEDmRsyv1-/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

Let's continue to the `threes` position. How many `threes` can fit into `2`? None. We put a `0` in the `threes` position and calculate our remainder (`3 - 0` = `3`). Let's try the `ones` position. `2 x 1` is 2, so we put a `2` in the `ones` position and calculate our remainder.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yrvM-ULc2UxRFh4zLqgGYr07FlpePkF4/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

That's it! Our answer: `65` converted into base 3 is `2102`.

## Binary Numbers

Computer systems speak in **binary** (base **2**) numbers. Using two as the base is the lowest level of **abstraction**. In other words, binary is as *basic* as number systems get. We only need two numeral symbols, `0` and `1`, and we can still represent many things: a light switch turned `on` or `off`, a signal `sent` or `not sent`, a value `true` or `false`, a quantity `positive` or `negative`, and so on. 

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NQRLoaOj5IEEw3wzSDao4DdwFIq8vf2O/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

A zero is a slot means that exclude that position's value, and one means that we include it. SO the binary number 01101 is the quantity `8 + 4 + 1` = `13`. Each binary digit in 01101 is called a bit. Therefore, in this number there are *five* bits. The largest five-bit binary number is `11111` which is `16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1` or `31`. 

Let's try converting the number 37 to binary. We could use the same method of creating slots and, starting from the largest slot, we'll work our way down to see what "fits". 

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12umIF-BKpriRKf_1BEQtvyctc9kb19dW/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

There is also another method. It has to do with a special property of numbers raised to the second power: they're all even! So let's convert 37. We begin by noticing that it is odd, so we put a `1` and divide by 2. `37` / `2` = `18.5` and discard the remainder (` = 18`). `18` is even, so we write a `0`. `18 / 2` is `9` which is odd, so we write a `1`, and so on.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EyoQimRYBhbuAMGVu7tJOsAYlIQGdgaG/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

In reading the numbers from bottom to top, we get `37` in binary is `100101`.

## Binary Arithmetic

Adding two binary numbers is practically the same as adding two base 10 numbers: line up the columns and then proceed from right to left. 

However, in binary there are only four possible cases:
- If a column has no `one`s, write a `zero` below. `0` + `0` = `0`
- If a column has one `one`, write a `one` below: `1` + `0` = `1`
- If a column has two `one`s, write a `zero` and carry a `one` to the next column: `1` + `1` = `1` with carry of `1` to the left column. 
- If a column has three `one`s (due to an incoming carry), write a `one` and carry a `one` to the next column.

Below is an example of adding `10110` and `11100`. The result is `110010`, and you can see the four possible cases below.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jYTxevs64SwXZgis7DAiq7kx-DIfs4RW/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

We can also check our answer by converting both `10110` (= `22`) and `11100` (= `28`) as well as our answer `110010` (= `50`) to decimal notation. We find that `22` + `28` = `50`, so our answer of `110010` is correct. 

## Fixed-Size Representation

In base 10 notation, we can arrange numbers along a number line and, in either direction, it goes off into infinity. In binary, we can do the same. We can keep counting and adding more slots that are powers of two. 

However, in many computer systems, we use **fixed-size** numbers. This means that  the number of bits we can use is already determined. For example, a **4-bit computer** represents most of its numbers and addresses using exactly 4 bits. The largest such number `is 2<sup>4</sup> - 1` or `1111` which is equal to `15`. 
In a **32-bit computer**, the largest number is `2<sup>32</sup> - 1` = `4,294,967,295`. Today, many computers now use **64-bits** for which the largest number is `2<sup>64</sup> -1` = `18,446,744,073,709,551,615`.

When your numbers have a fixed size, there is no number line heading off to infinity. Instead, the numbers are arranged around a circle or wheel. Below is the number wheel for 3-bit binary. 

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_fPqoYqE5apxC59-4436A1OHcwyKDIKl/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

Above is the number circle for 3-bit integers. The smallest is `zero` and the largest is `seven`. If you attempt to keep counting beyond `7`, it simply wraps around to `zero` again. 

Why? When you perform arithmetic with fixed-size numbers, you throw away any extra carry bit because you cannot exceed the given size. For example, see what happens when we try to add `110` + `010` using 3-bit numbers.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kwAPprcxauEqHamizkF9kauOlpuRAnts/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe> 

In 3-bit arithmetic, `6` + `2` is `0`. This makes sense if you think of it like walking clockwise around the number wheel. Start at `6` and move clockwise 2 spaces. We land on `0`, which is `6` + `2`.

## Two's Complement

Up until now, it seems that binary can do *almost* everything that base 10 can. But how can we represent *negative numbers* in binary? One way to do represent **signed numbers** (positive or negative numbers) is called **two's complement**. Below is the general layout of a 4-bit two's complement. All we need to do in two's complement is to make the value of the left-most bit negative. <br>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B0-k_etkL9gLehdWHGmG9XOEb53-UTiN/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

To represent `6` in binary, we write `0110` because `4` + `2` equals `6`. But to write `-6` in binary, we write `1010` because `-8` + `2` = `-6`. 

Likewise, to write `-1` in binary, we write `1111` because `-8` + `4` + `2` + `1` is equal to `-1` in two's complement. 

It is important to note that the rules for binary addition also apply (and work!) for two's complement: <br>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TSXSH_FNMcJet074UkFJAPUfV8r1cix4/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

It is also easy to **negate** a number, that is, to go from `+4` to `-4` or from `-8` to `+8`. The steps for going from:
1. Invert all the bits. In other works, all the ones become zeros and all the zeros become ones. 
2. Add one.

For example, to calculate `-6`, we know that `6` is `0110` and all we have to do is negate it. 
1. Invert the bits: `0110` becomes `1001`.
2. Add one: `1001` + `1` = `1010` (which equals `-6`)

To go from `-6` to `+6`, we don't have to reverse these steps. Just do the same.
1. Invert the bits: `1010` (`-6`) becomes `0101`
2. Add one: `0101` + `1` = `0110` (which equals `+6`)

## Octal & Hexadecimal

The **octal** (base 8) and **hexadecimal** (base 16) systems are useful as *abbreviations* for binary. Octal and hexadecimal work well because 8 and 16 are powers of two. 

Octal uses the symbols `0` through `7` and the value of its columns are:

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tjVvDNGvxXhI03NnNsDzl_VrcSR3BAC9/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

The advantage of octal is that each octal digit **maps to three binary digits**. 

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hQlB6yvt55_SsHJuy29h79cS1SF_Fo-C/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

**Hexadecimal** is base sixteen, so we use the symbols `0` through `9`, and `A` to represent `10`, `B` for `11`, `C` for `12`, and so on up to `F` for `15`. The values of the slots are:

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1te2yK0KxdUSTyc-FpbPO9RUFk84hKu4_/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

So, the hexademical number `2A5C` has the value `2 x 4096 + 10 x 256 + 5 x 16 + 12 x 1` which is equal to `10844` in base 10. 

In hexadecimal, each digit **maps to exactly four bits** in binary.
