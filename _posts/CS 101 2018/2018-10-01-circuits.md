We understand how to convert our real-world (numbers, text, images) into binary, but how does a computer understand binary? 

## Boolean Algebra

In the 1854, George Boole developed a set of operators and laws (an **algebra**) for 
variables that can have just two states (true and false). **Boolean algebra** 
is used to create, analyze, and use digital circuits (aka **logic circuits**) 
because zeros and ones are interpreted as signals in a computer.

### Boolean Algebra Rules
These are the important rules in Boolean algebra.
- Variables can have only two values (`1` = `HIGH` = `true` and `0` = `LOW` = `false`).
- The **complement** (aka the `NOT` operation) of a variable is represented by a comma (`'`). For example, the complement of variable `A` is represented as `A'`. Therefore, if `A` originally equals `0`, then `A'` equals `1` (flip the value).
- The `OR` operation is represented by a `+` (plus) sign between two variables. For example, `A OR B OR C` is written as `A + B + C`.
- The `AND` operation is represented by a `·` (dot) sign between two variables. For example, `A AND B AND C` is written as `A · B · C`. Sometimes, this operation is inferred, so we can instead omit the dot and write `ABC`.

### Boolean Laws
There are six laws in Boolean algebra.
- The **commutative law**: `A + B = B + A` or `A · B = B · A`.
- The **associative law**: `(A · B) · C = A · (B · C)' or `(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)'
- The **distributive law**: `A · (B + C) = A · B + A · C`
- The **AND law**: 
	- `A · 0 = 0`
	- `A · 1 = A`
	- `A · A = A`
	- `A · A' = 0`
- The **OR law**:
	- `A + 0 = A`
	- `A + 1 = 1`
	- `A + A = A`
	- `A + A' = 1`
- The **NOT law** (aka *law of inversion*): `A'' = A`

### DeMorgan's Theorem

Simply, `(A · B)'` is equal to `(A' + B')`.

## Logic Gates

**Logic gates** (aka *transistor gates*) are the basic building blocks of any digital system. These gates have one or more inputs, but only one output. However, the relationship between the inputs and output must be based on a certain logic (hint: **Boolean algebra**). Based of Boolean algebra, the gates are accordingly named `AND` gates, `OR` gates, `NOT` gates, and so on. The following chart by [braulio777](https://www.instructables.com/id/Basic-Logic-Gates/) shows the symbols, expressions, and **truth tables** we use to denote these gates.

## Combinational Circuits

We combine different gates to make various **combinational circuits**. For example, `(A · B) ·  C` can be drawn as (images by [Jimb0](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/logicblocks-experiment-guide/all))

![Circuit diagram](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/6/07-animation_3AND.gif) 

With three inputs, we can make `2<sup>3<sup> = 8` combinations. This number grows exponentially as `2<sup>n<sup>`, where *n* is the number of inputs. So, a 4-input circuit has `2<sup>4<sup> = 16` possible combinations, 5 inputs would produce `32` outputs, and so on.

Because the above combinational circuit has 3 inputs (which we name `A`, `B`, and `C`), we can create a three-variable truth table (4 columns: 3 for inputs, and 1 for the output).

```cpp
	A	B	C	(AB)C
	0	0	0	= 0
	0	0	1	= 0
	0	1 	0	= 0
	0 	1 	1	= 0
	1	0 	0	= 0
	1 	0 	1 	= 0
	1 	1 	0	= 0
	1 	1 	1	= 1
```

If we attach a light (an **LED**) at the end of our circuit, it would only turn on when all three inputs are `on` (`= 1`).

First, try to derive the boolean expression from the following diagram, and create its truth table.

![Circuit diagram](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/6/20-combinational_circuit.png)

1. We can see that inputs `A` and `B` are connected through an `AND` gate. This is `= A · B`.
2. Input `C` goes through an `NOT` gate. The output of the `NOT` is written as `= C'`.
3. Then, `(A · B)` and `C'` become inputs to an `OR` gate. Their output is `= (A · B) · C'`
4. Finally, the output of the previous `OR` gate becomes negated. The output of the final `NOT` gate is `= ((A · B) · C')'`

We can simplify this by using the boolean laws we previously discussed.
1. `((A · B) · C')'` becomes `(A · B · C')'` due to the *associative law*
2. `(A · B · C')'` becomes `A' + B' + C''` due to *DeMorgan's theorem*
3. `A' + B' + C''` becomes `A' + B' + C` due to the *inversion law*
4. *Optionally*, we can revert this to see how it matches the diagram simplification into ((A · B)' · C) by *DeMorgan's theorem backwards*. However, this is not considered the **simplest boolean expression**.

The corresponding truth table is:

```cpp
	A	B	C	A' + B' + C
	0	0	0	= 1
	0	0	1	= 1
	0	1 	0	= 1
	0 	1 	1	= 1
	1	0 	0	= 1
	1 	0 	1 	= 1
	1 	1 	0	= 0
	1 	1 	1	= 1
```

To simplify this diagram from the diagram alone, we can repeat these same steps. The last two gates are a `OR` followed by a `NOT` gate. We can combine these to make an `NOR` gate:

![Circuit diagram](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/6/23-combinational_circuit_2.png)

Then, let's apply *DeMorgan's theorem* by combining the `NOT` with the `NOR` gate, turning it into an `AND` gate. But this creates `NOT` gates on both inputs:

![Circuit diagram](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/6/24-combinational_circuit_3.png)

Finally, the two `NOT` gates on input `C` would cancel each other out. The `NOT` gate on the first `AND`'s output can be combined with the `AND` to get:

![Circuit diagram](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/2/1/6/25-combinational_circuit_4.png)

This is **simplest diagram** of these boolean expression because it used the least amount of gates. Previously, when we simplified this using only boolean algebra we 
got an answer of `A' + B' + C`. In a diagram, this expression, as is, requires 4 gates (2 `NOT`s and 2 `OR`s).
