# Posts need to have the `post` layout
layout: post

# The title of your post
title: SI.11 Coding Challenge 8 - Scrolling

   Create a game that includes interactions between sprites, score, and levels. The game is similar Flappy Bird, where the goal is to keep an object from falling to the ground or touching certain objects.

# (Optional) Link to an image that represents your blog post.
# The aspect ratio should be ~16:9.
image: /assets/img/default.jpg

# You can hide the description and/or image from the output
# (only visible to search engines) by setting:
# hide_description: true
# hide_image: true

# (Optional) Each post can have zero or more categories, and zero or more tags.
# The difference is that categories will be part of the URL, while tags will not.
# E.g. the URL of this post is <site.baseurl>/hydejack/2017/11/23/example-content/
categories: [Summer Institute, Coding Challenges]
tags: [Scratch]
# If you want a category or tag to have its own page,
# check out `_featured_categories` and `_featured_tags` respectively.
