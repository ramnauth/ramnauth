# Posts need to have the `post` layout
layout: post

# The title of your post

# (Optional) Write a short (~150 characters) description of each blog post.
# This description is used to preview the page on search engines, social media, etc.
description: >
   An outline for Scratch project presentations.

# (Optional) Link to an image that represents your blog post.
# The aspect ratio should be ~16:9.

# You can hide the description and/or image from the output
# (only visible to search engines) by setting:
# hide_description: true
# hide_image: true

# (Optional) Each post can have zero or more categories, and zero or more tags.
# The difference is that categories will be part of the URL, while tags will not.
# E.g. the URL of this post is <site.baseurl>/hydejack/2017/11/23/example-content/
categories: [Summer Institute]
tags: [Scratch]
# If you want a category or tag to have its own page,
# check out `_featured_categories` and `_featured_tags` respectively.

You will have to give a short 5-6 minute presentation of your Scratch project. The following resources include a template presentation, an example Scratch presentation, and the critique outline.

## Presentation Slides Template

The following is a template. [Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor). Keep it simpleâ€”no audience ever complained about a presentation being short.

## Content Resources

For any content, not text, these are some sources for standardizing the look of your presentation.

* [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/): free vectors, photos and PSD downloads

* [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/): the largest database for free icons

* [Snipping Tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snipping_Tool): a screenshot utility for windows

* [Scratch Exporting](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Exporting_and_Importing): converting sprites, stages, and scripts to transferrable images

* [Best of Google Fonts](https://www.awwwards.com/20-best-web-fonts-from-google-web-fonts-and-font-face.html): if you need something spicier than Times New Roman and Arial.

## Example Scratch Presentation

## Tips to Presenting

**Watch the following talk without sound or captions.** Then, with the volume on. In this TED Talk, Will Stephen highlights the importance of non-verbal language. On the other hand, we'll be intensifying that effect with meaningful content.

## Giving Feedback

For giving (**indirect**) constructive criticism on Scratch projects, refer to the following handout.

For giving (**direct**) feedback on presentations, the same questions and topics apply, but we'd instead have Q&A sessions.
