## Assessment Format
This is less of an assessment than it is a game of [musical chairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_chairs). 
You'll be presented a programming task to write/solve. Whoever finishes last is out of the game. The person/team that finishes first will be awarded the most points. 
However, those that are eliminated from the game can rejoin by critiquing (finding a way to break) someone else's code. The individual left or with the most points by the end of the week wins. 

## Submission Requirements
1. Multiple submissions allowed
2. Title/number each program
3. Use comments to explain what's happening in your program
4. Use style guidelines to keep organized
