# Posts need to have the `post` layout
layout: post

# The title of your post
title: General Style Guidelines

# (Optional) Write a short (~150 characters) description of each blog post.
# This description is used to preview the page on search engines, social media, etc.
description: >
   Guidelines to writing "pretty" code, applicable to *most* programming languages

# (Optional) Link to an image that represents your blog post.
# The aspect ratio should be ~16:9.
image: /assets/img/default.jpg

# You can hide the description and/or image from the output
# (only visible to search engines) by setting:
# hide_description: true
# hide_image: true

# (Optional) Each post can have zero or more categories, and zero or more tags.
# The difference is that categories will be part of the URL, while tags will not.
# E.g. the URL of this post is <site.baseurl>/hydejack/2017/11/23/example-content/
categories: [CS 102]
tags: [Programming Basics]
# If you want a category or tag to have its own page,
# check out `_featured_categories` and `_featured_tags` respectively.

This is an attempt to describe how code should be formatted. It's a combination of my notes when I was learning programming and what I've learned from my students. This reference sheet will get better over time as I add to it and organize it further.

## Indentation

Always tabs, or always four spaces ([Silicon Valley - S3 E6](https://youtu.be/SsoOG6ZeyUI)). Choose one. Stick with it. 

## Spacing

- Always a space after `if` and the bracket. Use `if (blah) {`, not `if(blah){`. 
- No single line `if` blocks
	```cpp
	if (blah) {/* do something */}
	else {/* do something else */}
	```
	Instead use
	```cpp
	if (blah) {
		/* do something */
	} else {
		/* do something else */
	}
	```
- No spaces at inside ends of parens
	```cpp
	if ( blah ) // bad
	if (blah ) 	// badder
	if (blah) 	// good
	```
- If multiple conditions, space out each operator and symbol
	```cpp
	if ((x&&y)||(z%10==0)) 			// bad
	if ((x &&y) ||(z %10 ==0) )		// badder
	if ((x && y) || (z % 10 == 0)) 	// good
	```
- An empty block should be { } not {} with an explanation as a comment
	```cpp
	if (emptyBlock) {
		// a useful comment here about why this case is skipped
	}
	```
- Use spaces *after* a commas: `aFunction(apple, banana, celery)` not `aFunction(apple,banana,celery)`
- Use spaces before and after use of `+`
	``` cpp
	string good = "this is an " + "excessive use " + "of quotes to demonstrate concatenation.";
	string bad = "this is the "+adjective+" wrong way "+exclamation+" and is difficult to read";
	```
- Spaces before and after operators in almost all cases: `for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {`
- Use parentheses to clarify the order of operations: `int a = 13 + (b * 12) + (c * 5);`

## Brace Yourself

- Always use braces:
	```cpp
	if (i = 0){ //good
		i = 5;
	}
	```
	Never choose to omit the braces:
	```cpp
	if (i = 0) //bad
		i = 5;
	```

- Starting brace goes on the same line, end brace goes on its own. For example, an else statement should look like `} else {`

## Blank Lines
- Use two blank lines between function blocks
- One blank line after package declaration
- One blank line between imports and class definition
- One blank line between variables/imports that can be further categories (e.g., constants, math-related packages)
- No blank line after the function definition or before the closing brace

## Other Stuff
- Use `if (blah == null)` instead of `if (null == blah)`
- Use the ternary operator (`?`) if it most clearly saves multiple lines of code, i.e., `return (something == null) ? 0 : something`

## Functions
- If you need to change the number of parameters, add to the end. 
- Don't change the order of parameters when the function is already declared, defined, and called.
- Don't have alternate forms of the same functions with the same types of parameters (not overloading, but redoing).

## Comments
- Always one space after the `//` in single line comments
- Use `/* */` before a function to describe its purpose, even if the description fits on a single line

```cpp 
/* does something */
int aFunction () {
	int a = 0; // placeholder for user input
}
```

## New Lines
- Keep code under 80 columns. Break up statements if you must. 
- Avoid excessive chaining, where dots are placed at the end/beginning of multi-line indented poetry

## Layout
- Don't stack declarations/definitions
	```java
	public static final int STATUS_EMPTY = 100, STATUS_COMPILER_ERR = 200, STATUS_WARNING = 300, STATUS_INFO = 400, STATUS_ERR = 500;
	```
	Because perhaps someday, you're going to need to change something and won't easily find it. Use:
	```java
		static final int STATUS_EMPTY = 100;
		static final int STATUS_COMPILER_ERR = 200;
		//...etc
	```
- You don't have to be cute and *tab-align* for symmetry. It's subjective, but if it helps with readability by all means be cute.
	```java
	string grocery = "Buy " 	+ num1 + 	adjective 	+ " apples 		\n" +
					 "Taste " 	+ num2 + 	verb 		+ " bagels 		\n" + 
					 "Find " 	+ num3 + 	adverb 		+ " jellybeans	\n"
	```

## Names

- Everything (e.g., functions, variables, classes) should have a purposeful name that relates to what it does
- Names should not be a smash of more than 2 words. `getName()` is good, but `getNameFromTheUserWhoExistsOnTheOtherSideOfTheConsole()` is silly.
- Primitive variables should be a lowercase single word (e.g., `num`)
- Objects and classes should be a single word, first letter capitalized (e.g., `Student`)
- Functions can be either one or a smash of two words, first word lowercase, second word capitalized (e.g., `getValue()`)
- Constants should be in all uppercase letters (e.g.,`INT_MAX`)
	
## Copyrights & Attribution
- Your full name, the date, version no., title, and the purpose of your program should be in a multiline comment at line 1 in the format below.
	```cpp
	/*
		Rebecca Ramnauth
		Advanced Calculator Project v.6.0.1
		28 September 2018
		
		A calculator with an digital interface for the console,
		capable to performing + - / * and % operations.
	*/
	```
- If you need to cite a source/reference, include the link and describe what you used the source for in a multiline comment. 
	```cpp
	/* 	
		font from: fontawesome.com 
		color from: colorpicker.com
		equation adapted from: https://github.com/rramnauth2220 | @rramnauth2220
	*/
	```
- When possible, cite on a per function basis. 
- If using external APIs or other resources that influence the program generally, include a README.txt file in the first level of your source repository

## Philosophical 
- Multiple classes in one file is okay, but don't reference the inner classes from the same file
- Order `if-else-if` blocks. Where possible, make the default case the first part of the `if` block
