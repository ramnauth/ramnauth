# Posts need to have the `post` layout
layout: post

# The title of your post
title: Programming in Style

# (Optional) Write a short (~150 characters) description of each blog post.
# This description is used to preview the page on search engines, social media, etc.
description: >
	Guidelines to writing "pretty" code, applicable to most programming languages

# (Optional) Link to an image that represents your blog post.
# The aspect ratio should be ~16:9.

# You can hide the description and/or image from the output
# (only visible to search engines) by setting:
# hide_description: true
# hide_image: true

# (Optional) Each post can have zero or more categories, and zero or more tags.
# The difference is that categories will be part of the URL, while tags will not.
# E.g. the URL of this post is <site.baseurl>/hydejack/2017/11/23/example-content/
categories: [CS 102]
tags: [Programming Basics]
# If you want a category or tag to have its own page,
# check out `_featured_categories` and `_featured_tags` respectively.

This is an attempt to describe how code should be formatted. It's a combination of my notes when I was learning programming and what I've learned from my students. This reference sheet will get better over time as I add to it and organize it further.

## Indentation

Always tabs, or always four spaces ([Silicon Valley - S3 E6](https://youtu.be/SsoOG6ZeyUI)). Choose one. Stick with it.
