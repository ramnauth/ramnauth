**Prompt**: your program should 
1. generate a random number for the user to guess
2. ask the user to guess the number
3. say if guess was "high" or "low"
4. repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number

**Variations**
1. Your program plays that guessing game [as previously described](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20102/2018/10/03/class-sprint-2/#variation-1)
2. [Limit the number of the tries/attempts/guesses](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20102/2018/10/03/class-sprint-2/#variation-2) the user has to select the correct number
3. [Generate a different "random" number each time the game is played](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20102/2018/10/03/class-sprint-2/#variation-3)

### Variation 1

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void guessingNumberGame(); // a prototype to let the compiler know that this function exists

int main(){
    guessingNumberGame();
    return 0;
}

int enterNumber(){ // this function is only responsible for storing and returning the value of cin
    int num = 0; // defined as 0
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num;
    return num;
}

void guessingNumberGame(){
    int ans = rand() % 100 + 1;
    int guess = 0;
    while (guess != ans){
        guess = enterNumber(); // lets the user make another guess
        if (guess > ans){
            cout << "Too HIGH! Try again." << endl;
        } else if (guess < ans) {
            cout << "Too LOW! Try again." << endl;
        }
    }
    cout << "Congrats! You guessed the correct number!" << endl;
}
```

### Variation 2

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void guessingNumberGame(int limit); // a prototype to let the compiler know that this function exists

int main(){
    guessingNumberGame(5);
    return 0;
}

int enterNumber(){ // this function is only responsible for storing and returning the value of cin
    int num = 0; // defined as 0
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num;
    return num;
}

void guessingNumberGame(int limit){
    int ans = rand() % 100 + 1;
    int guess = 0;
    do {
        guess = enterNumber();
        limit--;
        if (guess > ans){
            cout << "Too HIGH! " << limit << " attempts remaining." << endl;
        } else if (guess < ans) {
            cout << "Too LOW! "<< limit << " attempts remaining." << endl;
        }        
    } while (guess != ans && limit > 0);
    if (limit < 0)
        cout << "YOU LOST. You ran out of attempts." << endl;
    else if (guess == ans)
        cout << "YOU WON! You guessed the correct number!" << endl;
}
```

### Variation 3

The number returned by `rand()` is called *random* because it satisfies 
statistical tests for randomness (e.g., [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous)), no [correlation or dependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence) between sequential numbers). 
Neither humans nor computers can generate *truly random* numbers. We say computers are [*deterministic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm) (given the same inputs, we get the same output) Instead, we say the "random" numbers generated by a computer are **pseudorandom** numbers.

For a given **seed** (starting value), the numbers that `rand()` returns will always be the same. This is because the starting point for whatever algorithm generates the pseudorandom numbers.
If we tested our previous `Guessing Number Game` programs, we realize that the computer always generates the same "random" number (`84`). This is because the seed of pseudorandom algorithm is always the same (by default, our seed is `1`).

Having the same number generated each time can be useful for debugging, but it isn't very useful when you actually want to honestly (without knowing the correct answer) play the guessing game. To generate a different random sequence, it's necessary to change the seed. The `srand()` (`s` for `seed`) function takes a positive integer parameter which tells the algorithm where to start.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

using namespace std;

void guessingNumberGame();

int main(){
  guessingNumberGame();
  return 0;
}

int enterNumber(){
    int num = 0;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num;
    return num;
}

void guessingNumberGame(){
    srand(2); // set the seed to 2
    int ans = rand() % 100 + 1; // ans will always equal 91
    int guess = 0;
    while (guess != ans){
        guess = enterNumber();
        if (guess > ans){
            cout << "Too HIGH! Try again." << endl;
        } else if (guess < ans) {
            cout << "Too LOW! Try again." << endl;
        }
    }
    cout << "Congrats! You guessed the correct number!" << endl;
}
```

However, if I test my program, I find that my "random" number is consistently `91`. That's because, although I set the seed to `2`, the pseudorandom algorithm always starts at that seed. In other words, because our computer is deterministic, the same input produces the same output. 

What should the seed be if we want to get a different "random" number each *time* we run our program? Hint: [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time)

We can use the current time as the seed. While we run our program, play the game, then rerun the program, time has passed. To set the seed to the current time, we can use `srand(time(0))`. Your program will recalculate the seed every time you compile your code. The working solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib> // to use rand()
#include <ctime> // to get the current time

using namespace std;

void guessingNumberGame();

int main(){
  guessingNumberGame();
  return 0;
}

int enterNumber(){
    int num = 0;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num;
    return num;
}

void guessingNumberGame(){
    srand(time(0)); // set the seed to the current time
    int ans = rand() % 100 + 1;
    int guess = 0;
    while (guess != ans){
        guess = enterNumber();
        if (guess > ans){
            cout << "Too HIGH! Try again." << endl;
        } else if (guess < ans) {
            cout << "Too LOW! Try again." << endl;
        }
    }
    cout << "Congrats! You guessed the correct number!" << endl;
}
```
