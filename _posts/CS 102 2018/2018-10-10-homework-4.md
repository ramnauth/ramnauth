For this assignment you will program the game of [hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) in C++. 

## Game Requirements
1. Choose the word to guess randomly from an array of preselected strings. For example, 
```cpp
string words[5]= {"strawberry", "lime", "orange", "lemon", "mango"};
// program randomly chooses a word from this hard coded list.
```
2. Allow the user to guess only an alphabetic letter (`A` to `Z` (uppercase) or `a` to `z` (lowercase))
3. Each round, display the correctly guessed letters and their placement in the word. For example: `* * * *` may become `* * m *` when the user guesses `m` for the word `lime`.
4. Keep track of the number of points/the score. You can be creative with how points are allocated, but your method should be purposeful/reasonable. ~~Points are determined by the number of correctly guessed letters in a given word. For example, `strawberry` is a total of `10` points because there are ten letters in the word.~~ 
5. Instead of a display for the arms, legs, etc., display the number of attempts left. In hangman, there is a head, 2 legs, 2 arms, and a torso, so `6` wrong guesses are allowed.
6. Each round, display all previously guessed letters, regardless of whether they were right or wrong.
7. After each game, regardless of win or lose, ask the user if he/she wants to play again.

## Submission Requirements
- Prettify your code ([Style Guidelines](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20102/2018/09/26/style/))
- Cite your sources/references using comments (`//` or `/* */`)
- Use comments, where appropriate, to explain your code/logic
- How did you test your program? Track bugs and how you resolved them with comments.
- Consider how your will present your game's code/logic

**Note:** if you program does not work, demonstrating how you tested/debugged your program will earn you credit.

## Hint [10/22/2018] 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

string words[5]= {"strawberry", "lime", "orange", "lemon", "mango"};
int score = 0;
int attempts = 6;
string correctWord = words[rand()%5];
vector<char> display;
vector<char> guesses;

char enterLetter() {
    char c; 
    cout << "Enter a letter: ";
    cin >> c;
    return c;
}

void updateDisplay(char c) { // display correctly guessed letters
    for (int i = 0; i < correctWord.size(); i++) {
        if (c == correctWord.at(i)) {
            display.at(i) = c;
        }
    }
}

void initializeDisplay() {
    for (int i = 0; i < correctWord.size(); i++) {
        display.push_back('*');
    }
}

void printVector(vector<char> v) {
    for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
        cout << v.at(i) << " "; 
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    initializeDisplay();
    printVector(display);
    char guess = enterLetter();
    updateDisplay(guess);
    printVector(display);
    return 0;
}
```

## Suggestions/Outline
The following is an outline of one solution. You are not required to use these functions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;

void initialize(vector<char> v); // initializes game and its display
string getWord(); // gets a random word from global array 'words'
vector<char> convertWordToVector(string w); // converts a word into a vector
void printVector(vector<char> v); // prints a vector
char enterLetter(); // asks for a char, checks if char is a letter
bool checkLetter(char c, vector<char> v); // checks if char is in vector and not previously chosen
bool contains(char c, vector<char> v); // checks if vector contains the char
void updateDisplay(int points, bool good); // shows updated score, highscore, display, and attempts left; points comes from updateDisplayVector
int updateDisplayVector (char c, vector<char> v); // updates displayed vector, returns the number of changed chars
void playHangman(); // plays the actual game
void playAgain(); // asks the user to play the game again

string words[5]= {"strawberry", "lime", "orange", "lemon", "mango"};
vector<char> display; // letters guessed correctly and their placement
vector<char> prevLetters; // tracks which letters were previously guessed
int score; // number of letters correct
int attemptsLeft; // decrement only if wrong letter guessed
int highscore = 0;

int main() {
    playHangman();
    return 0;
}

void playAgain() {
    string ans;
    cout << "Want to play again? ";
    getline(cin, ans);
    if (ans.find('y') >= 0 || ans.find('Y') >= 0)
        playHangman();
}

void playHangman() {
    vector<char> goodLetters = convertWordToVector(getWord());
    initialize(goodLetters);

    while (attemptsLeft > 0 && score < display.size()) {
        int points = 0;
        char guess = enterLetter();
        bool goodGuess = checkLetter(guess, goodLetters);
        if (!contains(guess, prevLetters)) {
            prevLetters.push_back(guess);
            points = updateDisplayVector(guess, goodLetters);
        }
        updateDisplay(points, goodGuess);
    }
    if (attemptsLeft <= 0) {
        cout << "You lost! The word was "; printVector(goodLetters);
    } else {
        cout << "You won!" << endl;
    }
    playAgain();
}
```
