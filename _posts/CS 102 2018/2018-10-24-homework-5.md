For this assignment you will program [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) in C++. 

## Game Specifications
1. A grid of 10 rows (labelled `0` through `9`) and 10 columns (labelled `A` through `J`). 
2. Place 1 ship on the grid. The following attributes of a ship should be randomly determined.
	- ship's x-position must be on the grid.
	- ship's y-position must be on the grid.
	- ship's length must be between `1` and `5` spaces long, and should fit on the grid.
	- ship's direction can be either horizontal or vertical.
3. Allow the user to guess the location by specifying the column (a letter) and row (an integer) in a single input.
```cpp
	string guess;
	cout << "Guess a location: "; // example: "A4" means column 0, row 4.
	getline(cin, guess);
```
4. Place symbols on the grid to denote "hits" and "misses"
5. The game ends, when the ship is completely "sunk"
6. (*Optional*) Implement a score-tracking system or some other creative/new aspect to your game.

**Note:** 
- **10%** of your assignment grade is based on the submission requirements described below
- **40%** of your assignment grade is based on your fulfillment of game specifications #1 - 5.
- **50%** of your assignment grade is based on the *creative* aspects of your game or code.

## Submission Requirements
- Prettify your code ([Style Guidelines](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20102/2018/09/26/style/))
- Cite your sources/references using comments (`//` or `/* */`)
- Use comments, where appropriate, to explain your code/logic

**Note:** if your program does not work, demonstrating how you tested/debugged your program will earn you credit.
