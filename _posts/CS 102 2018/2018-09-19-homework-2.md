# Posts need to have the `post` layout
layout: post

# The title of your post
title: Assignment 2 due Thurs, Sept. 27

# (Optional) Write a short (~150 characters) description of each blog post.
# This description is used to preview the page on search engines, social media, etc.
description: >
   **Assigned** Wednesday, 9/19/2018. **Due** Thurs, Sept. 27 at 6:00 AM.

# (Optional) Link to an image that represents your blog post.
# The aspect ratio should be ~16:9.

# You can hide the description and/or image from the output
# (only visible to search engines) by setting:
# hide_description: true
# hide_image: true

# (Optional) Each post can have zero or more categories, and zero or more tags.
# The difference is that categories will be part of the URL, while tags will not.
# E.g. the URL of this post is <site.baseurl>/hydejack/2017/11/23/example-content/
categories: [CS 102]
tags: [C++, Assignments]
# If you want a category or tag to have its own page,
# check out `_featured_categories` and `_featured_tags` respectively.

Write a C++ program that takes two user-inputted integers (a value and a base) and successfully converts the value into the specified base. Use comments to demonstrate your thought process.

Sample console output: 
`-----------------------------` <br>
`Base 10 --> Base X Converter` <br>
`----------------------------- `
`   Enter a value: ` 8 <br>
`   Enter the base: ` 2 <br>
`	Confirm: convert 8 into base 2? (Y/N)` Yes <br>
`   ... ` <br>
`   Answer: 1000` <br>

Be creative! Your output does not need to look exactly like this.

## Things to consider

- How can we generalize base conversions? In other words, is there an *algorithm* for converting to base 2 that would also work for converting numbers into base 7? <br> **Hint**: read my [section on converting decimal into binary numbers](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20101/2018/09/10/numbers/#binary-numbers)
- What will your program do if a user (wrongly) inputs an illegal value (such as a base of `3.74`)?
- What will happen if the user inputs `1` or `0` for the base? For the value? 
- What other exception cases might cause your program to 'break'? 

## Objectives

- Be able to use and store console input and give console output
- Be able to create, use, and manipulate the value of primitives (e.g., `int`, `double`, ...) and `strings`
- Demonstrate understanding of loops
- Consider exception cases (i.e., outside of the box)
- Approach programming as a problem solving task
- Demonstrate good practices for writing code (commenting, 'neat' formatting)
- Show your ability to Google responsibly. Cite your sources.
