A **data structure** is several data elements grouped together under one name. These data elements are also known as **members** or variables of different types and sizes. Data structures, aka **structs** for short, can be declared in C++ using the following syntax:
```cpp
struct StructName {
	member_type1 member_name1;
	member_type2 member_name2;
	member_type2 member_name2;
	...
};
```

An **object** can have a data type (as opposed to **primitives** which are `int` or `char`, etc.) of this structure. We can **instantiate** (aka create) an object by saying `StructName name_of_object`. 

This is useful, for example, when you want to represent a human being in your program, where you might want to store a `string name`, a birthday (`int birthDay`, `int birthMonth`, and `int birthYear`), and other characters about a person. You could do this:
```cpp
struct Person {
	string firstName;
	string lastName;
	int birthDay;
	int birthMonth;
	int birthYear;
	...
};
```
You have grouped these variables, where you once (before you knew about structs) might have written something like this:
```cpp
string firstName;
string lastName;
int birthDay;
int birthMonth;
int birthYear;
...
```
In this case, what happens if you wanted to store information about another person? You'd have to declare 5 more variables for each additional person. This can become too much to keep track off and your program will quickly get out of control.

## Defining and Declaring Structs
```cpp
struct Employee {
    int id;
    string firstName;
    string lastName;
    int age;
    double hourlyWage;
    string jobTitle;
    string jobDescription;
};
```
The above struct *declaration* tells the compiler that we're defining a new data structure called `Employee`. An employee is characterized by 7 members/variables. 

**Note:** One of the easiest mistakes when creating a `struct` is forgetting the semicolon at the end of its declaration. Like declaring a primitive variable `int num;` we end our declaration with a `;`

**Note:** It's by convention that we capitalize the structure's name (e.g., `Employee` not `employee`). Why? In English class, we capitalize proper names, including any person, *object*, place, project, etc. Although, "object" may mean something else in English class than in Computer Science, the definitions aren't really so different.

In order to use the `Employee` struct, we simply declare a variable of type `Employee`:
```cpp
Employee profMe;
```

This defines a variable of type `Employee` named `profMe`. It is also possible to define multiple variables of the same struct (like we can declare many `int`s in our program):
```
Employee profMe;
Employee detectiveSH;
Employee studentJS;
```

## Accessing Struct Members
When we define a variable such as `Employee profMe`, `profMe` looks for its struct's members. 
In other words, `profMe` already has an `int id`, `string firstName`, `int age`, ... declared. We just need to access it (using the **member selection operator**-- a period `.`) and *define* those member variables.

```cpp
Employee profMe;
profMe.id = 1003913;
profMe.firstName = "Rebecca";
profMe.lastName = "Ramnauth";
profMe.age = 37;
prof.hourlyWage = rand() % 100 + 11.50;
prof.jobTitle = "Professor of Computer Science";
prof.jobDescription = "Sleep. Eat. Code.";

Employee detectiveSH;
detectiveSH.firstName = "Sherlock";
detectiveSH.lastName = "Holmes";
detectiveSH.jobTitle = "Consulting Detective";
detectiveSH.jobDescription = "You know my methods, Watson.";
detectiveSH.id = 23987012;
detectiveSH.age = 43;
detectiveSH.hourlyWage = 0;
```

### Initializer Lists
Let's say you need to define 100 employees. Your program can get pretty long if you have to initialize each member at a time. Instead, C++ supports a faster way -- using an **initializer list**. This allows you to initialize some or all of the struct members on the same line you declared an object of that struct exists.
```cpp
struct Employee {
	int id;
	int age;
	double wage;
};

int main() {
	Employee john = {1, 45, 12.75};
	Employee maggie = {2, 34, 30.25};
	Employee alice = {3, 65, 0.00};
	return 0;
}
```

### Non-static Member Initialization
Starting with C++11, it's possible to give non-static (aka normal) struct members a default value. But you cannot mix this initialization method with the initializer list's syntax:
```cpp
struct Rectangle
{
    double length = 0.0;
    double width = 0.0;
};
 
int main()
{
    Rectangle x; // length = 0.0, width = 0.0
    x.length = 2.0; // WORKS - you can assign other values like normal
	
	Rectangle y = {5.5, 8.0}; // DOESN'T WORK
    return 0;
}
```
However, in C++14, this restriction was lifted and both can be used. 

## Structs & Functions
A huge advantage with structs is that we can pass the entire struct to a function that needs to work with its members:

```cpp
struct Employee {
    int id;
    string firstName;
    string lastName;
    int age;
    double hourlyWage;
    string jobTitle;
    string jobDescription;
};

void printEmployeeInfo(Employee e);

int main() {
    Employee me;
    me.firstName = "Rebecca";
    me.lastName = "Ramnauth";
    me.jobTitle = "Professor of Computer Science";
    me.jobDescription = "Sleep. Eat. Code.";
    me.id = 10019823;
    me.age = 37;
    me.hourlyWage = rand() % 100 + 11.50;

    printEmployeeInfo(me);
    
    return 0;
}

void printEmployeeInfo(Employee e) {
    cout << "Employee's ID: " << e.id << endl;
    cout << "Employee's Name: " << e.firstName << " " << e.lastName << endl;
    cout << "Employee's Age: " << e.age << endl;
    cout << "Employee's Wage: " << "$" << e.hourlyWage << endl;
    cout << "Employee's Annual Salary: " << "$" << e.hourlyWage * 40 * 52 << endl;
    cout << endl;
}
```

In the above code, we pass an entire Employee struct to `printEmployeeInfo`. Additionally, a function can return a struct, which is a great way to have a function return multiple variables.

```cpp
Employee randomEmployee();

int main() {
	Employee rand_guy = randomEmployee; // store returned Employee here.
    cout << "Random person's id: " << rand_guy.id; // print its id
    return 0;
}

Employee randomEmployee() {
    Employee randomPerson;
	randomPerson.id = rand() % 100000;
	randomPerson.firstName = "John";
	randomPerson.lastName = "Doe";
	randomPerson.age = rand() % 100 + 18;
	randomPerson.hourlyWage = rand() % 100 + 11.50;
	randomPerson.jobTitle = "Some jobTitle here";
	randomPerson.jobDescription = "Some jobDescription here";
}
```

## Nested Structs
Structs can also contain other declared structs.
```cpp
struct Job {
	string jobTitle;
	string jobDescription;
};

struct Employee {
    int id;
    string firstName;
    string lastName;
    int age;
    double hourlyWage;
	Job jobInfo;
};
```

If I wanted to know what someone's job title is, I can simply use the member selection operator twice: `myPerson.jobInfo.jobTitle;`

## Accessing Structs Across Multiple Files
Struct declarations don't take up any memory. If you want to reuse a struct declaration across multiple files, put the struct declaration in a header file (extension is `.h`), and `#include` that header file anywhere you need it.

**Note:** When you use `#include <file>` your compiler searches in the system directories and when you write #include "file" it searches in the project (or current) directories.
