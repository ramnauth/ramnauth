How does our high-level program gets translated and performed by our computer?

## 1. Editing

- **Input:** None
- **Output:** `hello.cpp`

A C++ program is essentially 'born' in a text editor where we write our code and save it as `hello.cpp`:

```cpp
// our hello world program

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	cout << "Hello World" << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

## 2. Preprocessing

- **Input:** `hello.cpp`
- **Output:** `hello.i`

In exploring the [anatomy of C++ program](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20102/2018/09/12/anatomy/), we became familiar with the purpose of the *preprocessor*. 
The preprocessor handles all *directives* (which are all the `#include`s). For example, the `iostream` file is taken from storage and placed 
into the `hello.i` with the original content of the `hello.cpp` file. The below `hello.i` file is the output of the preprocessor.

**Note:** To derive the `hello.i` file on your machine, use the `g++ -E hello.cpp -o hello.i` command.

## Compilation

- **Input:** `hello.i`
- **Output:** `hello.s`

When a program is *compiled*, it is converted to *assembly code* which is the middle ground between human-understandable code (such as C++) and machine-understandable code (binary).

**Note:** To derive the `hello.s` file on your machine, use the `g++ -S hello.i -o hello.s` command.

## Assemble

- **Input:** `hello.s`
- **Output:** `hello.o`

For the computer to understand your C++ program, it must be converted to *binary code*. The final output is an object file (later detailed in the Linking section).

**Note:** To derive the `hello.o` file on your machine, use the `g++ -c hello.s -o hello.o` command.

## Linking

- **Input:** `hello.o`
- **Output:** `hello`

The output of the Assemble stage are object files that correspond to content of the `.cpp` file. These object files are in machine language, but cannot yet be executed. *Linking* creates an executable file (`.exe`) from the object files. The command to link the assembly object files is `g++ hello.o -o hello`.
The `hello` file will look like the assembly object file because it is also in binary.

## Execution

Executing or *running* the `hello` file will print in the console `Hello World`. The command for execution is `.\hello`
