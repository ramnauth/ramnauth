Rewrite/expand on/explain the review sheet [(C++ Review Sheet as of 9/12/2018)](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20102/2018/09/11/cpp-review/) **in your own words**. The resulting C++ program should compile successfully. 

**Note:** Your submission does not need to be 100% different from the review sheet posted. Some commands can be written in the same way, but should be *explained differently* such as in comments (use `//`).

For example, the following program 

```cpp
#include <iostream> // the preprocessor handles this

// the main function must return an integer value
int main() { 
	std::cout << "Hello World"; // print to the console "Hello World"
	return 0;
}

// hello.cpp is complete
```

can be written/explained in another way:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // this is a directive for the preprocessor to find and place the file iostream here

using namespace std; // std = standard library
/* 
	C++ requires the main function to return an integer
	All main() does is say "Hello World"
*/ 
int main() { // this is the function's header/signature
	cout << "Hello World"; // cout prints to the console
	return 0; // main() said it was going to return an integer; it returns zero.
}
```

## Objectives

The purpose of this assignment is for students to:

- Demonstrate successful use of [repl.it](https://repl.it/) or installation of a C++ text editor (e.g., Virtual Studio Code) and C++ compiler (e.g., MinGW) on a personal computer
- Practice writing, debugging, and executing C++ programs
- Enforce the topics covered during class
- Prepare for Monday's (Sept. 17, 2018) quiz on the topics covered in the review sheet as well as the [C++ anatomy](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20102/2018/09/12/anatomy/) and [C++ life](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20102/2018/09/12/life/) notes.
