We have focused on writing programs that keep data in individual variables and use functions to operate on the data. Subsequently, we've learned to package variables/data together using [structures](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20102/2018/11/05/structs/). However, in structs, the data and its related functions are separate. Is there a way we can package not only related variables (as in structs) but also the related functions?

This is the heart of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**. OOP allows us to **encapsulate** both data and the set of functions that operate on the data into a **class**. In turn, a **class** is a set of **objects** that share a common structure (e.g., a set of attributes/**data members**) and a common behavior (e.g., a set of **member functions**).

The 'ingredients' for a class are:
- [The general format]() - *required*
	- `private` and/or `public` access specifiers
	- data members
	- member functions (including getters and setters)
- [Constructors]() - *optional*, but *recommended*
- [Destructor]() - *optional*, but *recommended*
- [Copy Constructor]() - *optional*

**Technical Vocabulary:**
- **class** - is a **super-ADT** (**abstract data type**) because it bundles traditional data typing info with the actions that will operate on that type
- **object** - if a class is a type, an object is a variable of that type. An object is called an **instance** of its class. 
- **messaging** - instead of calling a function to perform a operation on an object, you can send the object a message asking it to perform the operation on itself.
- **encapsulation** - each object has its own **private data** (that can be protected/hidden by the compiler) and a **public interface**. This ensures **data integrity**.

**Other OOP Vocabulary:**
- **superclass** - a parent class, a class that appears higher in the **hierarchy**
- **inheritance** - a new data type can be defined by modifying the definition of an existing data type. This is because the new type *inherits* all the data and behavior of its superclass.
- **polymorphism** - aka "many forms". The same message can be sent to more than one kind of object.
- **overriding** - a class inherits all the functions of its superclasses, but a class can choose to respond to a message in a different way by *overriding*/re-defining the function.

An example trying to tie-in these CS117 topics:
In many programming languages, integers, doubles, and floats are implicitly **polymorphic** because you can add, divide, and call all sorts of functions irrespective of the face that the types are different. (However, `int`s, `double`s, and `float`s are rarely considered 'objects' by the usual definition.)

More true to the definitions above, let's imagine we have a `Shape` class and all the classes that can **inherit** from it are its children: the `Square`, `Circle`, `Dodecahedron`, `Triangle`, and other shape classes. Each of these classes will **encapsulate** different data. For example, a `Triangle` **object** may need 
at least 3 points, whereas an object of the `Circle` class may need only a center and radius. By making the individual classes responsible for its code as well as its data, you can easily achieve **polymorphism*. If every class had its own `getArea()` function, the programmer could simply write: `shape.getArea()` to get the correct area for any shape. In contrast, the old (non-OOP) way of doing things, where the code was separate from the data, you would have functions such as `getSquareArea()` and `getCircleArea()`. 

Now, let's try to define the relationship between a `Square` and a `Rectangle` and a `Shape`. A `Shape` is the **superclass** (aka parent) of `Rectangle` which is the superclass of a `Square`. In reverse, a `Square` inherits all the variables and functions of the `Rectangle` which inherits all members from a `Shape`. So, if `Rectangle` defines `getArea()` to be `return (length * width)`, the `Square` class can **override** `getArea()` by stating that the function should instead `return (side * side)`. 

Although intended for the Java programming language, the following schema from [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J3f_OOPExercises.html), just as accurately captures these topics for C++.

## C++ Class General Format
```cpp
class ClassName {
	private: // an ACCESS SPECIFIER for all variables/functions that CANNOT be 'seen' outside of this class
		// declaration of DATA MEMBER (aka variables) go here
		// anything in this section is not accessible to the 'world'
		// (aka beyond the scope of this class)
		
	public: // an ACCESS SPECIFIER for all variables/functions that CAN be 'seen' outside of this class
		// this section is considered to be the interface
		// between and object's data members and the 'world'
		// (aka beyond the scope of this class)

}; // must end in a semicolon (like a struct)
```

Applying this general format to an `Animal` class:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Animal {
  private:
    string ownerName;
    string ownerAddress;

  public: 
    string scientificName;
    string petName;
    int id;
	
	// GETTERS (aka ACCESSORS) -- get info from a data member
    string getScientificName(){
      return scientificName;
    }
    string getPetName(){
      return petName;
    }
    string getOwner(){ // returns a private data mem so other classes can see/use it
      return ownerName;
    }
    string getAddress(){
      return ownerAddress;
    }

    // SETTERS (aka MODIFIERS) -- change values of a data member
    void changePetName(string newName){
      petName = newName;
    }
    void changePetOwner(string newOwner){
      ownerName = newOwner;
    }    
};

int main() {
  // Instantiate an object of class Animal
  Animal puppy;

  // Accessing data member of class Animal
  puppy.scientificName = "Canis Lupus Familiaris";

  // Accessing member function of class Animal
  cout << puppy.getScientificName() << endl;
  
  return 0;
}
```

## Constructors
A **constructor** is a member function that is automatically called when an object of a class is **instantiated**. A class can have several constructors, but every constructor must have the same name as the name of the class.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Animal {
  private:
    string ownerName;
    string ownerAddress;

  public: 
    string scientificName;
    string petName;
    int id;

    // a Default Constructor -- no parameters
    Animal() {
      scientificName = "";
      petName = "";
      id = -1;
      ownerName = "";
      ownerAddress = "";
    }
    // a Parametrized Constructor
    Animal(string sname, string pname, int identifier){
      scientificName = sname;
      petName = pname;
      id = identifier;
    }
    // another Parametrized Constructor
    Animal(string sname, string pname, int identifier, string owner, string add){
      scientificName = sname;
      petName = pname;
      id = identifier;
      ownerName = owner;
      ownerAddress = add;
    }

    //... getters/setters kept the same
};

int main() {
  // Instantiate an object of class Animal
  Animal puppy; // calls Default Constructor

  // Accessing data member of class Animal
  puppy.scientificName = "Canis Lupus Familiaris";

  // Accessing member function of class Animal
  cout << puppy.getScientificName() << endl;

  // Instantiate another object of class Animal
  Animal cat("Felis catus", "Fluffy", 123); // calls Parameterized Constructor
  
  // Accessing and modifying a data member's value
  cout << cat.getPetName() << endl;
  cat.changePetName("Kitty");
  cout << cat.getPetName() << endl;

  Animal goldfish("Carassius Auratus", "Dorothy", 1, "Rebecca", "1 Uni Plaza");
  cout << goldfish.getOwner() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

## Destructors
A **destructor** is a member function that is automatically called when an object goes out of existence (e.g., at the end of a function or the program). Destructors are important because they release the resources required for keeping an object 'alive'.

The general format of a destructor is `~ClassName(){}`. **Note:** a class can contain only one destructor.

Now with a destructor, our program

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Animal {
	/* ... include members from previously ... */
	public:
		/* ... include members from previously ... */
		~Animal(){
			cout << "Destructor called for animal with id = " << id << endl;
		}
		/* ... include members from previously ... */
};

int main() {
  Animal puppy;
  puppy.scientificName = "Canis Lupus Familiaris";
  cout << puppy.getScientificName() << endl;

  Animal cat("Felis catus", "Fluffy", 123);
  cout << cat.getPetName() << endl;
  cat.changePetName("Kitty");
  cout << cat.getPetName() << endl;

  Animal goldfish("Carassius Auratus", "Dorothy", 1, "Rebecca", "1 Uni Plaza");
  cout << goldfish.getOwner() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

outputs:
```
Canis Lupus Familiaris
Fluffy
Kitty
Rebecca
Destructor called for animal with id = 1
Destructor called for animal with id = 123
Destructor called for animal with id = -1
```

## Copy Constructors
A **copy constructor** is also a parameterized constructor that makes a copy of an object of the same class.

The general format of a copy constructor is:
```cpp
class ClassName {
	public:
		int var1;
		string var2;
		//.. and other data members
		
		// Copy constructor
		ClassName(const ClassName& objName) {
			var1 = objName.var1;
			var2 = objName.var2;
			//.. and other data members
		}
};
```

**Note:** like a destructor, we can't have any more than one copy constructor per class.

We can define a copy constructor for our Animal class:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Animal {
  private:
    string ownerName;
    string ownerAddress;

  public: 
    string scientificName;
    string petName;
    int id;
	
    // the Copy Constructor
    Animal (Animal& original) {
      scientificName = original.scientificName;
      petName = original.petName;
      id = original.id;
      ownerName = original.ownerName;
      ownerAddress = original.ownerAddress;
    }
	
	/* ... include members from previously ... */

};

int main() {
  Animal goldfish("Carassius Auratus", "Dorothy", 1, "Rebecca", "1 Uni Plaza");
  cout << goldfish.getOwner() << endl;

  Animal goldfish2(goldfish);
  cout << goldfish.getPetName() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
