**Overview**: For this assignment, you will design and give a **15-minute lesson** that builds upon a BUS 110 activity/assignment that you were proud of or inspired by. Your goal is to assume the role of the instructor and **introduce the class to a new topic**.

## Outline
Your PowerPoint slides should have the following elements, but must be focused on giving a meaningful lecture on your chosen topic:
1. An interesting title
2. Why is your selected topic important? 
3. Explorations into the topic itself 
4. How does this relate to the larger theme—to business and information systems? 

Be creative, but keep in mind how size, color, and objects (from [Death by PowerPoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo)) affect your overall presentation.
