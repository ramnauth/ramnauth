# Organization
The course takes place in a computer lab and helps students develop practical competences in the use of various computer systems and software. The course also provides a theoretical and practical introduction to systems and development concepts, technology acquisition, and various types of application software those has become prevalent or are emerging in modern organizations and society and that are essential to be competitive in today's job markets. This course is also suitable for majors in other disciplines who want to go beyond being casual users of computers to gain a deeper appreciation of some of the most important business computing and information technologies developed in the last fifty years. 

# Performance Indicators
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to: 
```cpp
PI 1. Apply multidisciplinary knowledge to the business and information systems environment

```

# Big Ideas & Units
This section relates the following big ideas with performance indicators 
```cpp
B 1. Introduction to Business and Information Systems  
B 2. Relationship to Other Disciplines and Skills        PI 1 
B 3. An Understanding of Business                        PI 2, 3, 4 
B 4. Business-Related Technology                         PI 5 
B 5. Information Management & Communication              PI 6 
B 6. Business Systems                                    PI 7 
B 7. Resource Management                                 PI 8 
B 8. Interpersonal Dynamics                              PI 9
```

Each big idea is analyzed under the following lenses. 
```cpp
1. Humanities (e.g., arts, literature, philosophy, and communication) 
2. Social Sciences (e.g., economics, human geography, law, political science, and sociology) 
3. Formal sciences (e.g., computer science, mathematics, and statistics) 
4. Applied Sciences (e.g., engineering and technology)
```

# Resources
We will use several resources:
- [https://ramnauth.github.io/](https://ramnauth.github.io/) - for notes, schedule, assignments, handouts, etc.
- [http://www.gradechamp.com/](http://www.gradechamp.com/) – for grades and feedback 
- *Business Driven Information Systems* [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Business-Information-Systems-Baltzan-Instructor/dp/0073402982) by Paige Baltzan and Amy Phillips (5th edition, ISBN 9780073402987).

# Grading
Your grade will be computed based on assignments, exams, quizzes, and participation. There is a total of 1,000 points available, broken down as follows:
- There will be **6 assignments**, one per big idea, during the semester. Assignments are worth **70 points each**, for a total of **420 points**.  
- There are **4 quizzes** scheduled throughout the semester to ensure you are following along with the lectures and online review resources. Quizzes are worth **45 points each**.
- There will be a midterm and final exam, worth **200 points each** for a total of **400 points**. 
 
On the 1,000-point scale, you can expect the following letter grades:  
```cpp
      >= 930: A      >= 770: C+  
      >= 900: A–     >= 730: C  
      >= 870: B+     >= 680: C–  
      >= 830: B      >= 600: D  
      >= 800: B–       else: F 
```

In the end, I may choose to adjust the scale slightly to compensate for assignments or questions that turned out to be trickier than I intended. Such adjustments would never lower your grade from what is designated in the above table; if you achieve 930 points, you are guaranteed an **A**. 

# Policies

**Lateness Factor.** It is important to complete tasks on time, 
so you don’t fall behind. Missed quizzes will receive a zero and 
cannot be made up. However, if you need to miss an exam, try to 
notify me in advance so we can make other arrangements. Late assignments 
will be graded using a lateness factor *f* — a real number in the range {0 . . . 1} 
that is multiplied by your earned score to determine a late score. It is defined as:

$$ f(x) = min(1.0, \frac{1}{ln(1 + \frac{h}{113}) + 1} ) $$

where the variable *h* represents the number of hours the submission is late. The table below shows some sample values of the late factor for increasingly late submission times. 

![Lateness Curve](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=1QlQBRNz_FldEl-i22x0dmuJd5gOeWnhX)

**Extra credit.** Students usually ask for extra credit late in the semester after they have already squandered their original opportunities. Be sure to start your work early, so that we can detect and solve any problems before they can affect your grade. 

**Plagiarism** is the use or presentation of ideas, words, or work that is not one’s own and that is not common knowledge, without granting credit to the originator. Plagiarism is a practice that is not only unacceptable but which is to be condemned in the strongest terms possible on the basis of moral, educational and legal grounds. Under University policy, plagiarism may be punishable by a range of penalties from a failing grade in the assignment or course to dismissal from the School of Business, Public Administration and Information Sciences. All students are required to read the handbook on avoiding plagiarism ([http://liucs.net/u2](http://liucs.net/u2)).

**Cheating** includes, but is not limited to the following: falsification of statements or data; listing sources that have not been used; having another individual write your paper or do your assignments; writing a paper or creating work for another student to use without proper attribution; purchase of paper or research work for one’s submission as their own work; using written, verbal, or electronic or other sources of aid during an examination (except when expressly permitted by the instructor, depending on the nature of the examination) or knowingly providing such assistance to aid other students. 

**Attendance.** Showing up on time to class is extremely important. If you must be absent or more than 5 minutes late, please try to notify me in advance. I will be keeping track of whether you are in class, and when you arrive. A few missed classes will not count against you, but habitual absence will significantly hurt your grade. Additionally, there will be no make-up quizzes. I do not distinguish between “excused” and “unexcused” absence. Unless you miss an exam due to a severe medical emergency, I don’t need to see a doctor’s note. If you do miss an exam, the make-up exam may be somewhat different from the one given in class. 

In accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, including changes made by the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008, the Long Island University **does not discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities**. If you are a student with a documented disability/ impairment (psychological, neurological, chronic medical, learning disability, sensory, physical) and require reasonable accommodations, please register with Student Support Services and provide me with an accommodation letter. Visit the Sloan Building 1st floor, call 718 488 1044, or visit Student Support Services ([www.liu.edu/Brooklyn/SSS/](www.liu.edu/Brooklyn/SSS/)).

The **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act** (FERPA) gives students control over the disclosure of their educational records. During this course, you may have the opportunity to create accounts or register with certain public online services. In these cases, you do not need to make any personally identifying information public. You may use a pseudonym or online handle, as long as you identify yourself to the instructor.
