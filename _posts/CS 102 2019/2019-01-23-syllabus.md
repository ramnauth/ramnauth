Welcome to CS 102, an introduction to the fundamentals of computer programming. 
Students design, write, and debug computer programs. No prior knowledge of programming is assumed.

# Objectives & Organization
Problem-solving, algorithmic design, and implementation using the C++ programming language are presented. Topics include fundamental data types and associated array types, I/O processing, conditional and loop constructs, use and implementation of functions. A brief overview of structures is given. Throughout the course, good programming styles and sound program construction are emphasized.  
The general sequence of topics is as follows: 
```
1. Introduction to Languages and C++     8. Pointers 
2. Variables / Assignments               9. Streams 
3. Branches                             10. Inheritance 
4. Loops                                11. Recursion 
5. Arrays / Vectors                     12. Exceptions 
6. User-Defined Functions               13. Templates 
7. Objects and Classes                  14. Additional Material 
                                            (e.g., containers, searching/sorting) 
```

# Performance Indicators
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to: 
```
PI 1. Understand and use the basic programming constructs of C++ 
PI 2. Manipulate various C++ data types (e.g., arrays, strings, and pointers) 
PI 3. Isolate and fix common errors in C++ programs using best debugging practices 
PI 4. Use memory appropriately, including proper allocation/deallocation procedures 
PI 5. Apply object-oriented approaches to software problems in C++ 
PI 6. Write small-scale C++ programs using the above skills 
PI 7. Demonstrate clean and manageable code practices, including documentation 
PI 8. Work effectively with team-oriented programming (e.g., Agile, pair-programming) 
PI 9. Transfer skills learned in C++ to other programming languages
```

# Resources
We will use several resources:
- [https://ramnauth.github.io/](https://ramnauth.github.io/) - for notes, schedule, assignments, handouts, etc.
- [http://www.gradechamp.com/](http://www.gradechamp.com/) – for grades and feedback 
- Microsoft Visual Studio Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/), our main text editor

Recommended texts include:
- *C++ Primer* [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113) by Stanley Lippman, Josée Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo (5th Ed.), ISBN-13 9780321714114 
- *Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++* [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-C-ebook/dp/B00KPTEH8C/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1548190067&sr=1-1&keywords=programming+principles+and+practice+using+c%2B%2B) by Bjarne Stroustrup (2nd Ed.), ISBN-13 978-0321992789 

# Grading
Your grade will be computed based on assignments, exams, quizzes, and participation. There is a total of 1,000 points available, broken down as follows:
- There will be **5 assignments** worth 50 points each, for a total of **250 points**.
- There will be **5 quizzes** worth 20 points each, for a total of **100 points**. 
- There will be **5 in-class activities** worth 50 points each, for a total of **250 points**. 
- There will be **2 performance assessments** worth **100 points each**.
- There will be **1 exam** worth **100 points**. 
- There will be **1 final project** worth **100 points**.

On the 1,000-point scale, you can expect the following letter grades:  
```
>= 930: A      >= 770: C+  
>= 900: A–     >= 730: C  
>= 870: B+     >= 680: C–  
>= 830: B      >= 600: D  
>= 800: B–       else: F 
```

In the end, I may choose to adjust the scale slightly to compensate for assignments or questions that turned out to be trickier than I intended. Such adjustments would never lower your grade from what is designated in the above table; if you achieve 930 points, you are guaranteed an **A**. 

# Policies

**Lateness Factor.** It is important to complete tasks on time, 
so you don’t fall behind. Missed quizzes will receive a zero and 
cannot be made up. However, if you need to miss an exam, try to 
notify me in advance so we can make other arrangements. Late assignments 
will be graded using a lateness factor *f* — a real number in the range {0 . . . 1} 
that is multiplied by your earned score to determine a late score. It is defined as:

$$ \[f = min(1.0, \frac{1}{ln(1 + \frac{h}{113}) + 1} )\] $$

where the variable *h* represents the number of hours the submission is late. The table below shows some sample values of the late factor for increasingly late submission times.
