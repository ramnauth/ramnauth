Write your own **text adventure game** as discussed in class. Zork is one of the early interactive computer games classified as a 'text adventure' (link to play: [http://zorkonline.net/](http://zorkonline.net/)).

**Requirements:** Your game should
- have *at least* **5 major if-statements**. Note that if-else statements can be nested. In the example below, there is one parent if-statement that contains a `if-else if-else`. This counts as 1 if-statement towards this assignment.
```cpp
if (/* boolean expression */){
	if (/* another expression */){
		...
	} else if (/* yet another expression */){
		...
	} else {
		...
	}
} else {
	...
}
```
- have *at least* **1 switch statement**.
- have *at least* **1 loop**
- have an appropriate and interesting storyline
- generally follow the ['pretty code' guidelines](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20102/2019/02/20/style/)

Be prepared to present and explain your code in class.
