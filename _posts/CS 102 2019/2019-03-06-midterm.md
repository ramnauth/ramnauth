There are **four** parts to this exam. All solutions must be solved in pen/pencil on the exam. 

As it is more a review than an 'exam', take your time to practice solving these questions without a computer and within the recommended time frame (at the top of each part).

Feel free to reach out to your instructor by email [(rebecca.ramnauth@my.liu.edu)](mailto:rebecca.ramnauth@my.liu.edu).
