# You can hide the description and/or image from the output
# (only visible to search engines) by setting:
# hide_description: true
# hide_image: true

# (Optional) Each post can have zero or more categories, and zero or more tags.
# The difference is that categories will be part of the URL, while tags will not.
# E.g. the URL of this post is <site.baseurl>/hydejack/2017/11/23/example-content/
categories: [CS 102]
tags: [C++, Programming Basics]
# If you want a category or tag to have its own page,
# check out `_featured_categories` and `_featured_tags` respectively.

You may submit more than one program using the provided [submission portal](https://forms.gle/PQGNEkAghFwdANGT9). Be careful not to overwrite your previous programs by using the same repl. Each submission should have:
- Your full name
- The sprint/program number
- Your repl.it link

If you don't complete your program within the time limit of the sprint, it is better to submit what you have than to submit nothing at all. This is not an assessment of completeness. 
Your programs should be neatly formatted and with appropriate comments.
