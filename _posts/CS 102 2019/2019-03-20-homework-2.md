Write your own *strange* calculator that meets the following requirements: 
- *at least* **five** 'strange' functions. Instead of the traditional calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides numbers, think creatively about functions that aren't usually done by a calculator; for example, adding `strings` instead of numbers, performing `modulus`, or calculating the force of an object given its mass and acceleration. 
- an **overloaded** function name (that is, at least two functions with the same name)
- generally follow the ['pretty code' guidelines](https://ramnauth.github.io/cs%20102/2019/02/20/style/)

Be prepared to present and explain your code in class.
