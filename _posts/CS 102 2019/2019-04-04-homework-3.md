For this assignment you will program the game of [hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) in C++. 

## Game Requirements
1. Choose the word to guess randomly from an array of preselected strings. For example, 
```cpp
string words[5]= {"strawberry", "lime", "orange", "lemon", "mango"};
// program randomly chooses a word from this hard coded list.
```
2. Allow the user to guess only an alphabetic letter (`A` to `Z` (uppercase) or `a` to `z` (lowercase))
3. Each round, display the correctly guessed letters and their placement in the word. For example: `* * * *` may become `* * m *` when the user guesses `m` for the word `lime`.
4. Keep track of the number of points/the score. You can be creative with how points are allocated, but your method should be purposeful/reasonable. 
5. Instead of a display for the arms, legs, etc., display the number of attempts left. In hangman, there is a head, 2 legs, 2 arms, and a torso, so `6` wrong guesses are allowed.
6. Each round, display all previously guessed letters, regardless of whether they were right or wrong.
7. After each game, regardless of win or lose, ask the user if he/she wants to play again.

## Submission Requirements
- Prettify your code
- Cite your sources/references using comments (`//` or `/* */`)
- Use comments, where appropriate, to explain your code/logic
- How did you test your program? Track bugs and how you resolved them with comments.
- Consider how you will present your game's code/logic without any PowerPoints/slides.

**Note:** if your program does not work, demonstrating how you tested/debugged your program will earn you credit.

## In-Class Program
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

string answer;
string words[] = {"christmas", "thanksgiving", "presidents"};
vector <char> display(0);
int attempts = 6;

void printDisplay(){
  for (int i = 0; i < display.size(); i++){
    cout << display.at(i) << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}

void initDisplay(){
  for (int i = 0; i < answer.size(); i++){
    display.push_back('*');
  }
}

// return instances of letter
int checkLetter(char guess){
  int instances;
  for (int i = 0; i < answer.size(); i++){
    if (answer.at(i) == guess){
      display.at(i) = guess;
      instances++;
    }
  }
  return instances;
}

char enterLetter(){
  char guess;
  cout << "Enter a letter: ";
  cin >> guess;
  cout << "You have entered: " << guess << endl; 
  // check if input is really a letter
  while (!((guess >= 'A' && guess <= 'Z') || (guess >= 'a' && guess <= 'z'))){
    cout << "Invalid guess. Try again!" << endl;
    cout << "Enter a letter: ";
    cin >> guess;
    cout << "You have entered: " << guess << endl; 
  } 
  return guess;
}

bool isComplete(){
  for (int i = 0; i < display.size(); i++){
    if (display.at(i) == '*'){
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

int main() {
  srand(time(0));
  answer = words[rand() % 3] ;
  initDisplay(); // hide the word
  printDisplay();
  while (!isComplete() && attempts > 0){
    char guessedLetter = enterLetter();
    cout << "The letter " << guessedLetter << " appears " << checkLetter(guessedLetter) << " times." << endl;
    if (checkLetter(guessedLetter) <= 0) {
      attempts--;
      cout << "Wrong guess! You have " << attempts << " attempts left." << endl;
    }
    printDisplay();
  }  // game ended
  if (attempts <= 0) {
    // you lost
    cout << "Oh no, you lost! The word is " << answer << endl;
  } else {
    // you won
    cout << "Congrats!" << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
